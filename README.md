# Magic 8-Ball

The Magic 8-Ball is a popular toy developed in the 1950s for fortune-telling or advice seeking.

Write a magic8.py Python program that can answer any “Yes” or “No” question with a different fortune each time it executes.

We’ll be using the following 9 possible answers for our Magic 8-Ball:

* Yes - definitely
* It is decidedly so
* Without a doubt
* Reply hazy, try again
* Ask again later
* Better not tell you now
* My sources say no
* Outlook not so good
* Very doubtful

The output of the program will have the following format:

The output of the program will have the following format:

<code>
[Name] asks: [Question]
Magic 8-Ball’s answer: [Answer]
</code>

For example:

<code>
Joe asks: Is this real life?
Magic 8-Ball's answer: Better not tell you now
</code>


# Setting up the project

### TASK 01
In magic8.py, declare a variable name and assign it to the name of the person who will be asking the Magic 8-Ball.

### TASK 02
Next, declare a variable question, and assign it to a “Yes” or “No” question you’d like to ask the Magic 8-Ball.

### TASK 03
We want to store the answer of the Magic 8-Ball in another variable, which we’ll call answer. For now, assign this variable to an empty string.

### TASK 04
In order for the answer to be different each time we run the program, we will utilize randomly generated values.

Note: This will be something new! But don’t worry, we will try to explain this topic thoroughly and also supply the code.

In Python, we can use the .randint() function from the random module to generate a random number from a range.

But first, let’s import this module so we can use its functions. Add this line of code to the top of magic8.py:

<code>
import random   
</code>

### TASK 05
Next, we’ll create a variable to store the randomly generated value. Declare a variable called random_number, and assign it to the function call:

<code>
random.randint(1, 9)
</code>

which will generate a random number between 1 (inclusive) and 9 (inclusive).

Next, add a print() statement that outputs the value of random_number, and run the program several times to ensure random values are being generated as expected.

Once you’re sure this is working as we expected, feel free to comment out this print() statement.

### TASK 06
Now that we’ve declared all the variables needed, it’s time to implement the core logic of our program!

For this section, we’ll be utilizing control flow using an if/elif/else statement to assign different answers for each randomly generated value.

First, write an if statement where if the random_number is equal to 1, answer is assigned to the phrase “Yes - definitely”

# Control Flow

### TASK 07
Next, write an elif statement after the if statement where if the random_number is equal to 2, answer is assigned to the phrase “It is decidedly so”.

Then, continue writing elif statements for each of the remaining phrases for the values 3 to 9.

Recall that the 9 possible answers of the Magic 8-Ball are:

1.  Yes - definitely

2.  It is decidedly so

3.  Without a doubt

4.  Reply hazy, try again

5.  Ask again later

6.  Better not tell you now

7.  My sources say no

8.  Outlook not so good

9.  Very doubtful

### TASK 08
Following the if/elif statements, add an else statement that will set answer to the string “Error”, if the number was accidentally assigned a value outside of our range.

# Seeing the result

### TASK 09
Now, let’s see our program in action! Write a print() statement to output the asker’s name and their question, which should be in the following format:

<code>
[Name] asks: [Question]
</code>

For example, when we run the program, the output should look something like:

<code>
Joe asks: Will I win the lottery?
</code>

### TASK 10
Now, let’s see our program in action! Write a print() statement to output the asker’s name and their question, which should be in the following format:

Add a second print() statement that will output the Magic 8-Ball’s answer in the following format:

<code>
Magic 8-Ball's answer: [answer]
</code>

For example, when running the program it should look something like:

<code>
Magic 8-Ball's answer: My sources say no
</code>

### TASK 11
Great job! You’ve successfully utilized your knowledge of conditionals and previous fundamental Python concepts to create a program that generates different fortunes.

Run your program several times to see that it’s working as expected.

# Optional Challenges


### TASK 12
If you’re up for some more challenges, try implementing the following features to your program.

So far, the Magic 8-Ball provides 9 possible fortunes. Try to add a few more possible answers to the program.

To do this, you will need to increase the range of randomly generated numbers and add additional elif statements for each new answer.

### TASK 13

What if the asker does not provide a name, such that the value of name is an empty string? If the name string is empty, the output of the program looks like the following:

<code>
asks: Will I win the lottery?
Magic 8 Ball's answer: Outlook not so good
</code>

You can implement this by creating an if/else statement such that:

If the name is an empty string, it will only print the question.
Else, the player’s name and question are both printed.

### TASK 14

What if the question string is empty? If the user does not provide any question, then the Magic 8-Ball cannot provide a fortune, otherwise, the fabric of reality is at risk!

To ensure that the fabric of reality is safe, we can create an if/else statement where:

If the question is an empty string, print out a message to the user.
Else, print the name and question, with the Magic 8-Ball’s answer.
